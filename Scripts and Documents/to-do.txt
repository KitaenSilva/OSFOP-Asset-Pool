During Kit encounter, add hint to go look around to find access to Glen Lake.

Comment on floor switches in Glen: "It looks like a toaster?"

Since I don't have clues in place yet, here's one:

"In order to deter theft, we've implemented an nine-stage mechanical lock. We have yet to move the treasury into the new vault, but testing of the lock has gone well."

And here's another:

"The lock's stages are connected in a linear fashion - each stage can only be interacted with by completing the stage before it."

And another:

"The switches in the north enable the switches in the south, but east activates west and west activates east."

And one more:

"The green stage is the last one, but we keep it in a high-traffic area so that at least someone will see it if someone unauthorized is trying to get into the treasury."
