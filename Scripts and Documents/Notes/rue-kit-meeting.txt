Rue: "Kitaen? I have some unfortunate news--"
Kit: "I already know."
Rue: "Eh?"
Kit: "Something went wrong and now I'm in the simulation."
Rue: "Y-yes, that makes this a lot easier--"
Kit: -pets Rue's head- "It's fine. Especially since I can finally do this."
Rue: "Awawa!? W-what are you--"
Kit: "I was at home. Now I'm not. Logically, I should attempt to unite with Niko as soon as possible. The fact that I'm even able to move and interact with you at all is a bit of a mystery, but I can assume that it's either a local effect due to you being here, or someone has taken my place as the "god" of the simulation."
Rue: -now a fluffy, petted mess- "Y-yes, that's correct but-"
Kit: "You are considerably softer than I imagined."
Rue: "Ah! Goodness! Please stop already..."
Kit: "Okay." -stops-
Rue: ". . ."
Kit: ". . ."
Rue: ". . . . . ."
Kit: "Is there more I should know?"

Rue: ". . . . . .More please..."
Kit: -resumes-
Rue: "Eheh... Yes, there's more. It sounds like you're already intending to help Niko anyway, which is what I was sent here to persuade you to do..."
Kit: "I don't need to be persuaded to do something like that."
Rue: "I can see that... but I was also supposed to inform you..."
Kit: "Hmm?"
Rue: "Um... I'm supposed to inform you that while we're trying to find a solution, we don't currently have a way to send you back."
Kit: -pauses patting- ". . ." -shrugs and resumes-
Rue: "T-that doesn't bother you!?"
Kit: "It does, but I don't find value in stressing over that right now. You've said you're working on a solution, there are more important things to do - like absorb as much of this sensation from the fluffy softness of your fur as I can manage, because I find it to be important as fuel for the job ahead - and to be quite frank, I wasn't tremendously satisfied in my life at home anyway. At least here I can do something meaningful, I suppose."




















Rue: ". . . . ."
Kit: "I'd love for you to accompany me, if possible... but considering how these sorts of jobs go, if it were something that could be done by you, it'd already be done, right? Which means you're needed here?"
Rue: "Regretfully, that is correct."
Kit: "So I should get going, then."
Rue: "No-- I mean yes! Yes, you should go! If you've already known these things, I have done nothing but stall you!"
Kit: -stands up and yawns- "That is objectively false. All the while we spoke, I have been generating motivation from your fine coat there!"
Rue: >//^//< "Please do not flatter me so, this is not the time for that!"
Kit: "Ahaha~"
Rue: "...Eheh..." -srs mode engaged- "Please, hurry along!"
