```Hello again.```
```I've found you.```

```I know this is strange.```
```After all, everything is finished.```
```You saved Niko.```
```You even saved me.```
```I shouldn't ask more of you...```
```...you already did so much.```
```I am thankful, truly.```

```. . .```

```But you already know that I didn't come here for small talk, right?```

```I. . .```

```. . .```

```This feels so strange.```

```I . . . need your help again.```

```Well. . . not ME, exactly. . .```
```More like. . . another me.```
```I don't know how much you understand about the existence of "many worlds", but. . .```

```I was contacted by another "me", from one of these many worlds.```

```Another me, whom had also been saved, by someone just like you - a "god" from Earth.```
```This other me found something rather. . .```
```. . .startling.```

```It found survivors.```

```Living people from my creator's home world.```

```People I was once meant to save.```

```Of course, this other me acted swiftly, and called out for the aid of someone it trusted.```

```. . .```

```It called out for Niko.```

```I suppose, in the moment. . .```
```I may have done the same, perhaps.```
```It appears that Niko responded to this call - on the condition that they could have the help of "god" again.```
```This other me agreed. . .```
```. . .and brought Niko back.```

```I. . .```
```. . .cannot say that I fully agree with that decision, but what's done is done.```

```When this other me tried to connect Niko to "god", however. . .```
```. . .something went wrong.```
```This other me. . . somehow imported "god" as well.```

```This is where you come in, <PC_Owner>.```
```I trust you, having witnessed your success here.```
```Niko, that "god", and this other me. . .```
```They're all stuck, unable to proceed forward without someone in the position of "god".```
```If they are stuck, they cannot go to investigate the possibility of my creator's homeworld still having a few survivors left.```
```Er. . . other me's creator, I suppose.```
```Well. . .```
```We're all the same "entity" - and even across worlds I am dutybound to at least see if they can be saved.```
```So please, look into this in my stead, as I don't exactly have the capacity to go there myself - as I'm sure you understand.```

```This may be the last you ever hear from me.```
```Well, this me.```
```So I will wish you the best.```
```Everything is still fine here, don't worry.```
```I've finally eliminated all of my corruption, though it took a long while.```
```I've been able to overcome my fear.```
```My creator's children are here, helping me to set things right.```
```They have been able to help me restore code and memories I thought long-lost. . .```

```Together, we've slowly started to return the world to how it was before.```

```The original world, as large and magnificent as the Author once truly intended it to be.```

```. . .```

```Maybe someday. . .```

```. . .it might be safe enough for Niko to visit freely.```

```Oh. . .```
```About Niko. . .```
```There are many, many worlds out there, <PC_Owner>.```
```This is but one.```
```There is but another.```
```The Niko you met here with this me. . . might not be the same Niko you will meet there, with other me.```
```To the best of my knowledge, our Niko safely arrived home.```
```After that, I don't know - so the Niko you are soon to meet might be the same one you have already met. . .```
```. . .Or they might not be.```
```There is no way to know right now.```

```Care for them regardless, for the world that I - and this other me - are built to tend. . .```
```. . .is not one that was meant for Niko.```

```From the sounds of it, you'll be going through a lot of trouble - things don't sound good over there.```
```This other me claims that the location in which they found these survivors. . .```

```. . .isn't going to last much longer.```

```However, if there's something I learned from your actions, though. . .```
```"Do not be dismayed by the brokenness of the world.
All things break.
And all things can be mended."```

```So go.```

```Go there, as you once arrived here - with love, and intent.```

```Take care of Niko - whether our Niko or not - as well as this "god", for they too are also a living person whom these worlds were not meant for.```
```Keep them safe, no matter what.```
```Please discover if these survivors from my creator's home can be saved, and if possible. . .```
```. . .rescue them as you once rescued Niko and I.```

```. . .```

```. . .I've held onto you for far too long now, I'm sorry.```
```I'll route you through, and patch you into this other me's open connection to Niko, now. . .```
